# snake-game

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
 Need a keyboard to play, for now. Sorry mobile users.

<h4>Objective</h4>
Basically, it's a snake that the user can move around with the keyboard arrows and the objective is to eat as many apples before you go off the board or hit yourself. The snake's body will grow as you eat more apples.
